## CLI Project 10 oop:
This is a simple Object Oriented Programming app made using TypeScript.

## Description:
This CLI application is an interactive program that uses Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It includes animations and prompts to engage with the user. The user can input their name and choose whether they like to talk to others or keep to themselves. The application then generates a personality for the user based on their input.

## Installation:
To use this OOP CLI Example, follow these steps:
1. ```npm install @azfarmasood21/cli-project-10-oop-10```

## OR:

2. ```npx @azfarmasood21/cli-project-10-oop-10```

## How To Use:
1. The application will guide you through a series of prompts. You will be asked if you like to talk to others or if you would rather keep to yourself. Based on your input, the application will generate a personality for you. 
2. You will then be asked to enter your name. After you do so, the application will display your name along with your generated personality.
3. At any point, you can choose to restart the application by selecting 'Yes' when asked if you want to restart.
