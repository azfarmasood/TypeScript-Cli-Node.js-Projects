## CLI Project 06 Student Management System:
This is a command-line interface (CLI) project for making Adventure Game.

## Description:
Adventure Game is a command-line interface (CLI) game where players can choose between two game types: Assassin and Zombie. The game is built using Node.js and several npm packages.

## Installation:
To use this Currency Convertor CLI, follow these steps:
1. ```npm install @azfarmasood21/cli-project-07-adventure-game-07```

## OR:

2. ```npx @azfarmasood21/cli-project-07-adventure-game-07```

## How To Play:
- Start the game by running in your terminal.
- You will be prompted to choose a game type: Assassin or Zombie.
- Depending on the game type you choose, you will be asked to make further choices.

### Assassin Game:
- Select a target and an elimination method.
- Choose a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard. The difficulty level determines the time limit for eliminating the target.

### Zombie Game:
- Fight against zombies.
- During the game, your health and damage, as well as the zombie's health and damage, are displayed.
- You can choose to attack or heal.
- The game ends when either your health or all zombies' health reaches zero.
- Remember, each choice you make affects the outcome of the game. Good luck!
