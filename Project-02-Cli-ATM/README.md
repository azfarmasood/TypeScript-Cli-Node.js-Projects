## Discription:
This is a simple ATM simulation project written in TypeScript. It allows users to perform various banking transactions, such as withdrawing cash, checking their balance, and making bill payments.

## How to Use:
1. When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your User ID and PIN.

2. You can select your account type (Current Account or Savings Account).

3. Choose the type of transaction you want to perform (e.g., Normal Withdrawal, Fast Withdrawal, Bill Payment, or Balance Inquiry).

4. Depending on your selection, you may be asked to specify the amount or the type of bill payment.

5. The program will check your balance and perform the transaction if you have sufficient funds.

7. You can continue to perform additional transactions or exit the program.
